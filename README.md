[![Verification: Self-checking](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verification-Self--checking-2ea44f.svg)](docs/README.md)

A compact, synthesizable UART core written in Verilog for learning digital
design, serial communication, finite-state machines, and RTL verification.
The project implements a complete transmit/receive path, a programmable baud
generator, a small register-controlled top level, and self-checking
testbenches.

## Overview

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) transfers serial data
without a shared clock. Both endpoints agree on the baud rate and frame format
before communication. A full-duplex connection uses two crossed data lines:
the TX output of each device connects to the RX input of the other device.

This repository focuses on a readable educational implementation rather than
a vendor-specific or production-ready peripheral. The design is split into
small RTL modules so that baud generation, transmission, reception, and
top-level integration can be studied and verified independently.

### Implemented Configuration

| Property | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Frame format | 8N1 |
| Data width | 8 bits |
| Bit order | Least-significant bit first |
| Parity | None |
| Stop bits | 1 |
| Idle level | Logic HIGH |
| Timing | 16× oversampling tick |
| RX input handling | Two-flop synchronizer |

## UART Frame

<p align="center">

</p>

A UART frame can support different data widths, parity modes, and stop-bit
counts. This core deliberately selects the common **8N1** configuration: one
LOW start bit, eight data bits, no parity, and one HIGH stop bit.

```text
Idle(1) | Start(0) | D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 | Stop(1)
```

The receiver validates the start bit near its midpoint, samples each data bit
at 16-tick intervals, and accepts the byte only after checking the stop bit.

## Architecture

### RTL Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`uart_baud_gen`](rtl/uart_baud_gen.v) | Generates the one-clock 16× oversampling tick from a programmable divider |
| [`uart_tx`](rtl/uart_tx.v) | Serializes an 8-bit value into an 8N1 frame and reports `tx_busy` |
| [`uart_rx`](rtl/uart_rx.v) | Synchronizes RX, validates the start bit, reconstructs data, and detects an invalid stop bit |
| [`uart_top`](rtl/uart_top.v) | Integrates the UART cores behind a small educational register interface |

Both protocol engines use the same four-state sequence:

```text
IDLE -> START -> DATA -> STOP -> IDLE
```

- TX accepts `tx_start_rise`, holds each frame section for 16 baud ticks, and
  shifts eight data bits before returning to IDLE after the stop bit.
- RX detects a LOW input, validates the start bit at `HALF_TICK`, samples eight
  data bits, and accepts or rejects the frame after checking the stop bit.

In the diagrams, `BIT_DONE` means `baud_tick && (bit_tick_cnt == 15)`, while
`HALF_TICK` means `baud_tick && (bit_tick_cnt == 7)`.

## Key Features

- Synthesizable Verilog RTL with synchronous active-HIGH reset.
- Fixed 8N1 framing with LSB-first serialization.
- Programmable baud divider shared by TX and RX.
- 16× timing for start-bit validation and receive sampling.
- Two-flop synchronizer on the asynchronous RX input.
- One-cycle `rx_valid` and framing-error events.
- Sticky receive-ready and framing-error status at the top level.
- Protection against overwriting an active TX frame.
- Module-level and end-to-end loopback verification.
- Repeatable command-line and QuestaSim waveform flows.

## Register Interface

`uart_top` exposes a deliberately small 2-bit address and 32-bit data
interface. It is intended to demonstrate peripheral integration and is not an
APB, AXI, or Wishbone interface.

| Address | Register | Access | Description |
|---:|---|---|---|
| `0` | `BAUD_DATA` | Read/write | 16× oversampling divider |
| `1` | `STATUS/ENABLE` | Read/write | Write bit 0 to enable the UART; read control and status |
| `2` | `TX_DATA` | Read/write | Write bits `[7:0]` to transmit; writes are ignored while disabled or busy |
| `3` | `RX_DATA` | Read | Read bits `[7:0]`; reading clears `rx_ready` |

Status bits returned from address `1`:

| Bit | Name | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| `0` | `enable` | UART enable state |
| `1` | `tx_busy` | A transmit frame is in progress |
| `2` | `rx_ready` | A valid received byte is available; sticky until `RX_DATA` is read |
| `3` | `frame_error_sticky` | An invalid stop bit was detected; sticky until status is read |

Disabling the UART resets the TX/RX cores and aborts any partial frame.

## Baud-Rate Programming

The baud generator creates the 16× tick used by both protocol engines:

```text
baud_division = clock_frequency / (baud_rate × 16)
```

For example, select an integer divider appropriate for the system clock and
target baud rate, write it to `BAUD_DATA`, and then set the enable bit. A
divider value of zero disables tick generation.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- GNU Make
- QuestaSim commands `vlib`, `vlog`, and `vsim` available in `PATH`

### Run the Complete Test Suite

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vohoangnguyennnn/uart-ip-core.git
cd uart-ip-core/sim
make test
```

The target runs all four self-checking testbenches and stops with a non-zero
exit code if compilation fails, an assertion fires, or a watchdog timeout is
reached.

### Run One Testbench

```sh
make TB=uart_tx_tb
make TB=uart_rx_tb
make TB=uart_top_tb
```

Running `make` without a `TB` override selects `uart_baud_gen_tb`.

### Open the Waveform GUI

```sh
make wave TB=uart_top_tb
```

The testbenches are also compatible with Icarus Verilog, and the synthesizable
RTL has been checked with Verilator lint. QuestaSim remains the documented
primary flow because `wave.do` provides grouped internal signals for protocol
inspection.

## Verification Coverage

The directed self-checking suite covers:

- Baud-generator enable, zero-divider, divider timing, and phase restart.
- TX serialization of alternating, all-LOW, and all-HIGH data patterns.
- RX valid frames, false-start rejection, and framing-error detection.
- Register read/write behavior and sticky status flags.
- End-to-end TX-to-RX loopback through `uart_top`.
- Rejection of a TX-data write while a frame is active.
